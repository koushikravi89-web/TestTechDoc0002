# Frequently Asked Questions


## Where do I find my catalog file?

When you first added your entity in the catalog, you created a YAML file containing information about your project.

By default, we suggest that you call the file `catalog-info.yaml` and store it in the main branch at the root of your repository.

If you are not sure where your catalog file is stored, you can find out in the XELERATE portal.

1. Navigate to the [XELERATE Software Catalog](/catalog) and find your entity in the catalog.
2. Click on your entity to go to your entity overview page.
3. Click on the "three dots" icon and choose "Inspect entity".
4. Scroll down to the **Metadata > Annotations** section and find the `backstage.io/managed-by-location`.
5. Click the link to navigate to the repository location where the file is stored.


## My project is already in the catalog, but I didn't add it. Where did it come from?

First, check that the entity in question represents your project and not a different project with a similar name.

Do this by looking at the external links, API specifications, or finding the [repository location](#Where-do-I-find-my-catalog-file).

If the project is being managed from a repository that you control, then you are free to make changes to update or expand the information provided.

If the catalog entry really represents your project, but is being managed by a *different* repository, please contact the [XELERATE team](faq.md#Contact-Information). We have seeded the catalog with a number of CARIAD projects that we are aware of. We encourage the creators and maintainers of those projects to take over the catalog entries and provide more accurate and up-to-date information than we have access to.
